HTML:

In this commit I have worked on the semnatics and added the following html tags to the index document:
1. header
2. main
3. figure
4. section
5. aside
6. footer
7. nav
The semantic tags give more information about the flow of the document and what each part represents.


CSS:

In addition, I have combined repetitive CSS commands that were not bound by class or had different classes for no practical reason. Likewise I have reorganized the sequence of CSS commands so they would follow the same logical orded as the HTML index document.


Other:
Furthermore, I have worked on various webpage details i.e font sizes, margins, paddings, width, height, etc. 

Looking forward to collaborative with class to see if I missed anything.

P.S You can find the deployed version right here --->
